# Chromium B.S.U. 0.9.13.2 i686
This is the same trainer configuration like I use with ugtrain on Linux. But
pointer following and auto-generating trainers with Cheat Engine really sucks.
CE has no wish value support. So I had to assign the hotkeys multiple times.

This cheat table and this auto-generated game trainer which is 4 MiB in size
have been generated with Cheat Engine 6.4.
